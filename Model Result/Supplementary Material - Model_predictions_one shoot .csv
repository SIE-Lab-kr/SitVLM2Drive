6) Traffic & Action Guidance: action: 'Yield', traffic regulations: 'TS_Yield'.
7) Conclusion: Given the unsafe condition, proceed with heightened caution.","Question: Step-by-step, explain how the ego vehicle should handle the current situation considering safety, causes, motion, intent, object interactions, and traffic guidance.
Answer: The ego vehicle should consider safety first. It should consider the current situation and the causes that require it to slow down, yield, and be prepared for sudden movements. It should consider its current motion and adjust it accordingly. It should consider its current goal",CCot
