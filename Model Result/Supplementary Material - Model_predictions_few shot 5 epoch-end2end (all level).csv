Step 5: Conclude that the situation is unsafe because: unsafe because t-intersections have two kinds of traffic lights for controlling, one for straight (green) and the other for turning (red) according to the ego's position in the lane for just turning left. also, the goal of the ego to turn left needs to follow the traffic light for turning control. ego moves until the intersection and stops, waiting for a traffic light control to turn left..
