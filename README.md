# SitLLM2Drive: Scene-Intent-Task for Causal Planning in AVs
**SitVLM2Drive** is a multimodal benchmark dataset designed for autonomous vehicle (AV) perception, planning, and reasoning in complex real-world scenarios. It integrates rich scene-level intent annotations, object-level causal graphs, structured Q&A pairs, and safety-critical reasoning — aligned under complex real-world conditions.

## 🔍 Annotation Levels

- **Scene-Level**: Caption, maneuver, cause, goal, safety, regulation, and action suggestions.
- **Object-Level**: Entities (vehicles, signs, pedestrians, etc.) with positions, safety impact, causal role, and semantic tags.

# Annotation Format: SitLLM2Drive

Each Scene-Level contains:

- `image_id`: Frame file name (e.g., "frame_000012.jpg")
- `caption`: Free-text summary
- `maneuver`: Intent/behavior (e.g., "Turn left")
- `cause`: List of contributing factors
- `goal-oriented`: Long-term AV objective
- `QA`: List of planning-based reasoning QA pairs
- `safe`: Safety status + rationale
- `Action Suggestions`: Recommended maneuver
- `Traffic Regulations Suggestions`: Road rule prompts

Object-Level are annotated with:
- obj_name, object_type, Bounding boxes or keypoints `boxes` or `point` coordinates
- Position: Relative spatial location
- Status
- Impact on safety: Affects / Requires Monitoring / Does Not Affect
- `Is_causal`: Cause / Effect (graph-linked)

Supported Object Domains:
- **Vehicles** (moving, parked, turning)
- **Road Users** (pedestrians, cyclists)
- **Infrastructure** (traffic lights, signs, markings)
- **Geometry** (intersections, lanes, medians)
- **Hazards** (potholes, debris)
