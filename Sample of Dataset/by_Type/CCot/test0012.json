Speed is 33.79 mph (Speed limit 15 mph).  A car directly ahead is braking, and another car is crossing the intersection with its brake lights on. A pedestrian crosswalk is ahead, requiring the Ego to yield. A railway crossing is visible to the right. The Ego must proceed cautiously, yielding to pedestrians and monitoring the cars in front.'.\n5) Object & Causal Analysis: Objects affecting safety: TS_Pedestrian_Crossing, traffic light, Railway_Crossing_Ahead_Skew_Left, car, road, Four-Way Intersection, Train Lane; Potentially affecting objects: car, car. Additionally, Causal relations: ego<po>711,708<po> -> drivable area<pl>329,677,1040,685</pl> (relation: Chain (causal)), car<bb>646,311,714,370<bb> -> ego<po>711,708<po> (relation: Direct (causal)), road<po>284,472</po> -> ego<po>711,708<po> (relation: Direct (causal)).\n6) Traffic & Action Guidance: action: 'moving', traffic regulations: 'TS_Speed_Limit_15'.\n7) Conclusion: As the scene is safe, the ego vehicle may proceed with its planned maneuver.",

Then, planned maneuver: 'travel down a 4 lane city street in the right lane and then turn right at a light traveling another half block then go straight and stop at the intersection and turn right and then go straight and drive straight and stop at the intersection and turn right and then go straight'. Follow directional traffic regulation advice: 'TS_Speed_Limit_15'. Step 4: Prepare to execute: 'moving'. Step 5: Conclude that the situation is unsafe because: no, pay attention. the ego aims to turn right at the four-way intersection, and the traffic light is green. this means looking for traffic before crossing, but having the pedestrian at the right crosswalk of the ego at the intersection crossing must give the pedestrian the right of way more than the ego..
