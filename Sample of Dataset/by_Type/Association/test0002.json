The traffic light controlling the vehicle's direction is green, allowing safe passage. An ambulance is ahead, crossing the intersection, with its emergency lights off. Another traffic light controlling the opposite direction is red. A pedestrian is standing on the right sidewalk. There is a 'No U-Turn' sign visible after the intersection. The vehicle is moving across the intersection. There are visible crosswalks ahead and on the right side, clear of pedestrians. The drivable area is free. The intersection is high importance due to its multiple elements affecting safety.",
